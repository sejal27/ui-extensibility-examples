# ui-extensbility-demo-projects

This repo contains a collection of hubspot developer projects. The focus of these various projects is to demonstrate the power of UI Extensibility through the creation of experimental cards with example use cases that developers **could build themselves** to extend the product in various ways.




# How do I get one of these projects into my portal?


After cloning this repo, you will notice multiple directories such as `inbound-labs-project/`. Once you know which project you want to upload you can follow the steps in the [Developer Platform MVP](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KWxer9QkSvLVRgqV3zXU0dYcCAJsqUd-Xl4Y66opCCc/edit#heading=h.i2swzfy205ef) instructions to ensure you have the right parcel, gates, and have installed the HubSpot CLI to eventually `hs project upload` a project to your portal.

**Note** that the `inbound-labs-project/` will require a secret from the [Developer Platform MVP](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KWxer9QkSvLVRgqV3zXU0dYcCAJsqUd-Xl4Y66opCCc/edit#heading=h.i2swzfy205ef) instructions in order to build successfully.
